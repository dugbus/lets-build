      <h1>Wordle Golf</h1>

      <p class="lede">Wordle is a web based word game created and developed by Josh Wardle. It became very popular
        towards the end of 2021 and was purchased by The New York Times in early 2022. Millions of people play Wordle
        every day on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">New York Times
          website</a> and in the NYT Games app.</p>

      <p><strong>Wordle Golf</strong> is a fun way to enjoy Wordle as a competition amongst friends.</p>

      <p>The Wordle for each day becomes a hole in a round of word golf with the number of guesses used to get the
        answer counting as the number of strokes taken on the hole.</p>

      <p>If you have ever played ball golf or disc golf before this will make more sense. But if you aren't familiar
        with
        how golf is usually scored just keep a running total of the number of guesses it takes you each day of the match
        and compare that total with the friends you are competing against to see who took the fewest guesses and wins.
      </p>

      <p>Having the added pressure of trying to get the answer in fewer guesses than your competitors introduces an
        extra layer of tactics that can lead to inspired guesses and massive blunders. I had a 400 day Wordle streak
        going when I unfortunately failed to get the answer in six guesses. This eventually cost me the Cubbon Cup
        below.</p>

      <p>If you prefer to use golf scoring, the par for each Wordle is four so getting the word in one guess is an
        <strong>Albatross</strong>, scoring three under par in golf terms. Guessing the word after two tries is an
        <strong>Eagle</strong>, giving the player two under for the hole. Taking three guesses is a
        <strong>Birdie</strong>, which is one under.
      </p>

      <p>Getting the word in four guesses is <strong>Par</strong>.</p>

      <p>Five and six guesses are a <strong>Bogey</strong> and <strong>Double Bogey</strong> respectively, giving
        the player a score of plus one or plus two.</p>

      <p>If you don't manage to find the word in 6 guesses you score it as a <strong>Triple Bogey</strong>
        seven.</p>

      <p>Decide what the penalty is for a missed day before you start the round.</p>

      <p>Golf rounds are generally eighteen holes long, so play each day for eighteen days in succession keeping a
        running total of the number of guesses you each took and the number above or below par that was scored.</p>

      <p>At the end of the round the person with the lowest total number of guesses is the winner!</p>

      <p>If eighteen days seems too much of a commitment you can always settle on a shorter nine hole round or just play
        for a week instead.</p>

      <p>We plan to play some games as match play instead of stoke play in the future and may even try a skins match for
        variety.</p>

      <p>For our inaugural match, which we called the Cubbon Cup, we all agreed to use the same starting word,
        <strong>YEARS</strong> but you will want go with you own choice if you already have a favourite.
      </p>

      <p>Pick a length for your match and a starting date to tee off on and take a swing at <strong>Wordle
          Golf</strong>.
